# The Elder Joseph of Optina
## Editorial Note

The following is an amateur reproduction of "The Elder Joseph of Optina", created out of a love for St. Joseph
in the hope that others who would like to learn about his life can do so more easily than I was able to as this book has been 
out of print for many years. When I finally found a copy I photographed each page and ran the photos
through OCR software to extract the text, manually fixing the copious associated errors.

While the text is as true to the original as possible, the page numbers do not match due to typesetting
differences. I also left out many of the decorative images, 
but included the original photos of people and places discussed. Original copyright info below.

Please forgive any shortcomings, flaws, and mistakes. May God accept this small effort, 
provide the correction and perfection it needs as he sees fit, and forgive my many offenses.

*St. Joseph, pray for us*
