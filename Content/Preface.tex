\chapter*{Preface}
\hugered{I}N PUBLISHING the present sketch of the life of the ever-memorable Elder of Optina Hermitage, Hieroschemamonk Joseph, the Saint Ambrose Women's Hermitage of Kazan\trans{This was the formal title of Shamordino Convent.} has had as its aim, on the one hand, to express thereby its deep appreciation and love toward their reposed spiritual guide, and on the other, to give at first at least a small consolation to all the spiritual children of the Elder Joseph and to all who revered him, inasmuch as it is well known that after the passing away of someone beloved, recollections of him serve as a great source of comfort.

Having quickly collected everything that is known about this wondrous Elder, the Ambrosiev Hermitage rests assured that Optina Hermitage will undertake the editing of all the material at hand, and will concern itself with the publication of a complete and detailed biography of this Elder, great in his humility, even as Optina has heretofore with such love labored in publishing the excellent descriptions of the lives and ascetic struggles of its earlier great Elders.
